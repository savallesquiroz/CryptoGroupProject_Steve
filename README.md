# Secure Communication Using RSA Encryption

## Description
This project demonstrates secure client-server communication using RSA encryption. The client sends encrypted messages to the server, which can process the messages without decrypting them for demonstration purposes. The server acknowledges receipt of the encrypted data.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.x and the following library:
- `pycryptodome`

To install the dependency, run:
```
pip install pycryptodome
```

### Installing

Ensure that `client.py` and `server.py` are in the same directory or a structured folder (e.g., `/communication/`).
